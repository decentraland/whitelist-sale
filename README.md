# Decentraland Whitelist Smart Contract

Contract for the Whitelist sale for Decentraland.

## Bug Bounty

A professional audit is being performed by independent contractors, but in the meantime, we invite you to review the code and provide feedback. The scope of the program is the logic of the WhitelistSale.sol smart contract.

The bug bounty program runs until we deploy the smart contract on Thursday 14th, 22:00 GMT.

### Compensation
Our team will assess each submission individually and assign a level of severity according to its likelihood and impact to the token sale. Compensation will depend on the severity of the issue found.

* Low: Up to $1,500 USD
* Medium: Up to $3,000 USD
* High: Up to $6,000 USD
* Critical: Up to $18,000 USD

Note that bounties will be paid in ETH after the sale has ended, and that Decentraland team members and paid auditors are not eligible for bounty compensation.

Please report bug bounty submissions to security@decentraland.org.
